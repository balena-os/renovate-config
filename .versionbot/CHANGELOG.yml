      body: |
        Renovate maintainers confirmed this setting does not work when in an
        extends. It must also be contained in a `renovate.json` file in the
        repository root, not for example in the `.github` folder.

        This reverts commit d791161359a57893bdcfb4c7649356c6aebd0409.

        This is needed so that renovate does not remove the versionbot build
        branch whics is created on the `store-github` task and is required for
        tagging on merge to master. The build branch is created in the
        `renovate` namespace so the renovate bot considers it a stale branch.
