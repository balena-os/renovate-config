      hash: 4b620bdb87f676f372e90e405d44491eec49e80a
      body: |
        Renovate docs suggest renovate.json should not be used for presets.
        Instead it is recommended to use default.json.

    - subject: "renovate: Disable pruning of stale branches"
      hash: 6ec36f80753bb28d45e8d23eef2652ece5024808
      body: |
        This is needed so that renovate does not remove the versionbot build
        branch whics is created on the `store-github` task and is required for
        tagging on merge to master. The build branch is created in the
        `renovate` namespace so the renovate bot considers it a stale branch.

      body: |
        This configuration is to be used in device repositories, and their
        versionist configuration requires a `Changelog-entry` to trigger instead
        of a `Change-type`.

    - subject: Adjust renovate configuration for digest updates
      hash: 948a717748dfb94dda69b4e37e97154acb26b5ba
      body: |
        The renovate git-submodule plugin does not support tag updates yet.

        Remove the matchUpdateTypes that referred to tag versioning, and
        add a `Update <dependency>` body for versionbot nested changelogs.
